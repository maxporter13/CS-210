# projectOne
projectOne was a struggle. I had to really refamiliarize myself with the language and do some light googling to find the materials I needed to help myself really be prepared to write the clock code. For example, I really had a hard time figuring out the logic for the hours. I could enhance my code by making the clocks children of an overarching clock class and having separate classes for the 12 and 24 hour clocks. 
# projectTwo
projectTwo went smoother than the first. I could definitely work on making my code flow better from start to finish, but when the user uses it, all that matters is that it works
# projectThree
oh gosh, this project is a mess. It doesn't quite work, my file reading and writing never quite worked as planned.
